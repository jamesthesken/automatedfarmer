# The Automated Farmer :herb:

The Automated Farmer is an open source hydroponic monitoring solution. If you're interested in building your own, please visit the website [here](https://theautomatedfarmer.com).


## Libraries being used:

1. [ESP-DASH](https://github.com/ayushsharma82/ESP-DASH): Used to create the user-interface. A very simple library and very recommended!
2. [ESPAsyncWiFiManager](https://github.com/alanswx/ESPAsyncWiFiManager): Used to avoid hardcoding WiFi credentials. A huge assistance to internet security!
